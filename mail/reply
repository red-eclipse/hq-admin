Hi there, here is your handle and user key for Red Eclipse ( https://redeclipse.net/ ). It will provide you with *player* status on all servers. Server owners may also add you to their localop user list to give you extra privileges with it.

Please add the following line to your 'autoexec.cfg':

- authkey ~USERNAME~ ~USERKEY~

If you do not know where to find this file, please see our guide ( http://redeclipse.net/wiki/Game_Settings ). If the file does not exist, you should create it. Alternatively, you can enter your handle and user key in the profile menu of your Red Eclipse client.

Please be advised that any *bouncing emails* will result in *account deletion*. We will only send user key resets to the original email address.

All Red Eclipse users also have a *free forwarding email address* so everyone can easily contact people they meet in-game. Emails to ~USERNAME~@redeclipse.net will be forwarded to your email address: ~USERMAIL~.

While we don't offer a mail server, you can send mail using this address if your provider supports "send as". Here are guides for some of the more popular services:
